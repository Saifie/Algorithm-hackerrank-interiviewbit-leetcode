 * Given two integers A and B, where A is the first element of the sequence then find Bth element of the sequence.
If the kth element of the sequence is X then k+1th element calculated as:
if X is even then next element is X/2.
else next element is 3Ã—X + 1.

1) use while loop for iteration modify A based on even and odd
